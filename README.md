# FreeVices

## Democratizing the small expenses you have on your vices

## Overview
The first complete app I made, 100% in Kotlin Compose, using the MaterialYou design guides, using [Dynamic Colors](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/color/DynamicColors?hl=en) (can be disabled in the application settings)
FreeVices offers a simple, card-based interface to show those small expenses you make on vices such as alcohol, tobacco, or partying and organizes them into categories to raise awareness about said expenses, and who knows, allow you to reduce those expenses. vices of your life.
